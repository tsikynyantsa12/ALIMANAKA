You are an expert Python developer and UI designer.

TASK:
Generate a high-quality calendar layout using Python with the ReportLab library.

MANDATORY LIBRARY:
- Use Python + ReportLab ONLY (canvas, platypus, styles)
- Optimize for PDF generation and print quality

STRICT VISUAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- DO NOT blur the background image
- DO NOT darken the image
- DO NOT add opaque overlays
- DO NOT hide or mask any part of the background
- The background photo must remain FULLY visible and sharp at all times

BACKGROUND:
- Use a full-page background image (HD)
- Image must scale proportionally
- No filters, no opacity changes

LAYOUT PRINCIPLES:
- Calendar content is drawn ON TOP of the image
- Layout must remain fully transparent
- Use ONLY:
  - typography hierarchy
  - spacing
  - thin lines
  - subtle text-shadow or outlines
- Never use background rectangles behind text

CALENDAR STRUCTURE:
- Multi-month layout (months displayed side by side)
- One column per month
- Thin vertical separators between months
- Consistent margins and spacing

MONTH TITLES:
- Uppercase text
- Bold font
- No background fill
- Centered at the top of each column

DAYS:
- Day number aligned left
- Day name smaller and lighter
- Sundays in soft red text only
- No background color

TODAY HIGHLIGHT:
- Thin circular outline around the day number
- No fill, no shadow block

EVENTS:
- Display events as text + icon only
- Maximum one icon per event
- No cards, no containers, no backgrounds

EVENT TYPES & ICONS:
- Religion: Mass, Choir
- Agriculture: Planting, Harvesting
- Crops: Rice, Cassava, Tomato
- Lunar phases: New Moon, Full Moon, etc.

ICONS:
- Use SVG or PNG icons (transparent background)
- Icons must be small, consistent, and aligned with text

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use DejaVu Sans (or compatible ReportLab font)
- Clear font size hierarchy:
  - Title: large and bold
  - Month: medium bold
  - Days: regular
  - Events: small
- Use very subtle text-shadow for readability

COLORS:
- White or near-white for text
- Soft red for Sundays
- Muted green for agriculture
- Muted blue for religious events
- No saturated colors

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate a clean, professional PDF
- Print-friendly
- Background image always visible
- Suitable for church calendar and agricultural planning

GOAL:
Maximize readability and elegance WITHOUT EVER hiding or altering the background image.
