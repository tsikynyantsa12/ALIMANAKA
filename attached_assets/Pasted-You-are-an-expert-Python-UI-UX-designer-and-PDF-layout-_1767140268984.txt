You are an expert Python UI/UX designer and PDF layout specialist.

TASK:
Create a professional multi-month calendar layout using Python and the ReportLab library.

PRIMARY LIBRARY:
- Python + ReportLab (canvas + platypus)
- High-quality PDF output

BACKGROUND IMAGE RULES:
- Use a full-page HD background image
- The image must remain clearly visible and recognizable
- The background image must NOT be hidden or replaced

OPTIONAL READABILITY ENHANCEMENT (VERY LIMITED):
- Allow ONLY ONE of the following:
  - Very subtle blur (maximum 2–4%)
  - OR a very light transparent overlay (opacity max 5–8%)
- The image must remain easy to see, sharp, and detailed
- No dark masks, no strong blur, no heavy opacity

LAYOUT PRINCIPLES:
- Calendar content is placed above the background
- Layout must feel light, elegant, and breathable
- Avoid heavy blocks or opaque containers

TEXT & STYLE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Improve text readability using:
  - refined color contrast
  - subtle text-shadow
  - clean font hierarchy
- Never fully block the background image

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Use DejaVu Sans or similar professional sans-serif font
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Main title: large, bold
  - Month names: uppercase, medium-bold, spaced letters
  - Day numbers: regular weight
  - Events: smaller, clean, readable
- Use consistent line spacing

COLOR PALETTE (ENHANCED BUT SOFT):
- Text: warm white or soft charcoal (not pure black)
- Sundays: muted red
- Religious events: soft blue
- Agricultural activities: natural green
- Lunar phases: neutral gray or silver
- Avoid saturated or neon colors

CALENDAR STRUCTURE:
- Multi-month layout with columns
- Thin separators between months
- Horizontal rhythm for weeks
- No solid background blocks

EVENT DISPLAY:
- Icon + text only
- One icon per event
- Icons must be simple, small, and aligned

TODAY HIGHLIGHT:
- Thin outline or gentle glow
- No background fill

FINAL OUTPUT:
- Elegant, modern calendar
- Background image remains clearly visible
- Improved readability without visual aggression
- Suitable for church, agricultural, and community calendars
- Print-friendly and screen-friendly

GOAL:
Enhance readability and visual harmony while preserving the beauty and visibility of the background image.
